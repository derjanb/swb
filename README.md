###[suckless,simple,simons] web browser

A minimal web browser based on webkitgtk.

## Current state
Almost useless. It's a work in progress.

## Why?
Because other minimal web browsers are not base on the webkit2 API.
The webkit2 API is where all the development takes place.

## Settings
Settings are changed by editing config.h and rebuilding the browser.

## Ad-blocking?
I use a custom style sheet for this, it works very well: http://www.gozer.org/mozilla/ad_blocking/css/ad_blocking.css.
