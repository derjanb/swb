###[suckless,simple,simons] web browser

A minimal web browser based on webkitgtk.

## Current state
Almost useless. It's a work in progress.

## Why?
Because other minimal web browsers are not base on the webkit2 API.
The webkit2 API is where all the development takes place.

## Settings
The home page can be changed in config.h. Rebuild the browser for the change to take effect.
