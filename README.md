###[suckless,simple,simons] web browser

A minimal web browser based on webkitgtk.

## Current state
I use it as my everyday browser. It seems rather stable.

## Why?
Because other minimal web browsers are not based on the webkit2 API.
The webkit2 API is where all the development takes place.

## Settings
Settings are changed by editing config.h, keys.h and events.h and rebuilding the browser.

One can also bind keys and events to execute scripts. See events.h and keys.h for examples.

## Ad-blocking?
I use an adblocking stylesheet and privoxy.
